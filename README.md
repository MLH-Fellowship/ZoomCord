# ZoomCord

This project is a part of the first hackathon among the Batch 1 pods.
We are a part of [Pod 1.0.5](https://github.com/orgs/MLH-Fellowship/teams/pod-1-0-5).

## Idea

The idea behind the bot is that we want this bot to be helpful for MLH community to organize their
Zoom meetings withing Dicord itself. So the bot would take care of creating, scheduling a new
meeting among a list of members through various commands.

## Dependencies

This bot primarily uses [Zoom API](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api) and
[Discord.jl](https://github.com/Xh4H/Discord.jl) to communicate with Zoom and Discord respectively.
The code is written is [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/) and is completely
open-source.
